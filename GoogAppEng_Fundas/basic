Endpoints are exposed to the UI

1. Got to let the JS library load,
<script src="https://apis.google.com/js/client.js?onload=init"></script>


2. That should intiate the call back to a function which sets the endpoints , which we have declared ,
gapi.client.load('helloworldendpoints', 'v1', loadCallback, rootpath);



3. Also we enable some event handlers to use endpoints functions
btn.onclick= function(){greetGenerically();};


4. This is how  they are going to call the endpoint function,
var request = gapi.client.helloworldendpoints.sayHelloByName({'name': name});
request.execute(sayHelloCallback);


5. Obviously there will be a callback to handle all the objects which will be returned by the endpoint function ,
Which is just going to be a Object
response.message


You can also build archetypes ,
mvn archetype:generate

Datastore
Database in the cloud

kinds (classes) , entity (Objects) , property ,

what is this annotation stuff ?

Data  store is going to have a lot of properties ,

Datastore stores Entities ,
They are recognised by key values

Now the point is how to save the entities in the data store ,
u will use objectify ,

Right now i just understand you can store some fundas in Datastore by Key and retrieve by the same key,
